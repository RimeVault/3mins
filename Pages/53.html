  <div id="b01" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbspHowever, when I get there, it's all too late.</span></div>
  <div id="b02" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbspI suppose the elimination towards me and Vermillion happends at the same time.</div>
  <div id="b03" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbspBut what does that call mean? A simple distress call? It can't be that easy.</span></div>
  <div id="b04" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbspThere's nothing worth noticing remained on Vermillion's body. Whoever killed him must have searched him, too.</span></div>
  <div id="b05" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="v">&nbsp&nbspVermillion:<br>&nbsp&nbsp"...take care of my wife and daughters."<br></span></div>
  <div id="b06" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbspIn a silver frame on the table, there was a photograph of Vermillion, a woman and two girls.</span></div>
  <div id="b07" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbspI levered the back off the frame, and one tape record was in it.</span></div>

  <div id="b08" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="v">&nbsp&nbspVermillion:<br>&nbsp&nbspI have to say that's interesting. Yeah. Well, old pal, there's one question that I particularly wanna ask.<br></span></div>
  <div id="b09" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbsp???:<br>&nbsp&nbspPlease, just say it.</span></div>
  <div id="b10" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="v">&nbsp&nbspVermillion:<br>&nbsp&nbspMy agent brought some intel about a drug named  <span class='eli'>Elixir. </span>. You know anything about this? Please tell me, just anything.<br></span></div>
  <div id="b11" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspSure. Its official name is KXPV178, and you call it <span class='eli'>Elixir. </span> </span></div>
  <div id="b12" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspIt's a drug made for military use about ten years ago.</span> </span></div>
  <div id="b13" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspFrom the appearance, <span class='eli'>Elixir</span> user would gain extraodinary moving speed and reacting speed, which made them almost invincible on the warfield. </span></div>
  <div id="b14" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspAccording to the users' description, when <span class='eli'>Elixir</span> is working, it almost feels like <span class='eli'>"time just freezes"</span>.</span></div>
  <div id="b15" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspAnd it was found in research that <span class='eli'>Elixir</span> can indeed slow down the time's flowing speed on users, thus make them inapproachable soldiers...</span></div>
  <div id="b16" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspThey can duck bullets, flash to enemie's back and escape from the battlefield after massacre with no trail left, like mist.</span></div>
  <div id="b17" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbsp...It helped our country win most of the battles, until something outrageous about this drug was dug out.</span>.</span></div>
  <div id="b18" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="v">&nbsp&nbspVermillion:<br>&nbsp&nbspWhat's it? Some side effect?</span></div>
  <div id="b19" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspYep, you can put it that way. During the first aid on a severely wounded soldier who took Elixir, doctors found out that even when this soldier's in shock, he's brain is still running at a surprisingly high speed.</span>.</span></div>
  <div id="b20" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspAnd that's not an individual case. Research showed that almost anyone who takes in Elixir is going into a <span class='eli'>"loop state"</span> when he or she is dying.</span></div>
  <div id="b21" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="v">&nbsp&nbspVermillion:<br>&nbsp&nbspLoop State?</span></div>
  <div id="b22" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspTo be more specific, when Elixir users are in agonal stage, their mind would travel back for some time, from one hour to several days, like dying flashback, but clearer and closer to reality.</span></div>
  <div id="b23" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspAnd during this time, though their consciousness is down under, their minds is still in breakneck running. When this routine finished, it would go back to the start and let the dying experience it again.</span></div>
  <div id="b24" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspThey can changed the past, like making choices that keep them away from danger. But no matter what they do or try to do, it is, after all, only happening in their brains.</span></div>
  <div id="b25" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspThat's not over. When they examined some soldiers' mental health condition after they recovered from deadly wound, a common phenomenon is they can't tell reality from illusion anymore.</span></div>
  <div id="b26" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspAfter maybe hundreds of routines they'd been through, they can't recognize if they are in real life or fantasy.</span></div>
  <div id="b27" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspWhat's worse, those loop experience once happened in their mind came back to haunt them again. They would see or hear obscure memory fragments in their dreams, while they're not true, just illusion.</span></div>
  <div id="b28" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspWhen the horrible fact is uncovered, the above stop Elixir's experiment immediately. But with countless soldiers are still suffering from endless nightmare. It has become a scar for our country.</span></div>
  <div id="b29" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="v">&nbsp&nbspVermillion:<br>&nbsp&nbsp...That's utterly shocking...</span></div>
  <div id="b30" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="r">&nbsp&nbspRealgar:<br>&nbsp&nbspI get it, pal. The reality is always darker than you could expect.</span></div>

  <div id="b31" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbspLoop...State?</span></div>
  <div id="b32" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbspIs that something I'm goona be trapped into, due to Elixir?</span></div>
  <div id="b33" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbspWell... At least it protect me from being murdered.</span></div>

  <div id="b34" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspNot really, Waki.</span></div>
  <div id="b35" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbspHart? Where are you?</span></div>
  <div id="b36" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspRiddle time: Why could I entry your room without holding a key? Why did I know your favorite is samurai spirit, while you never said that whole word? Why would you feel softened seeing me smiling?</span></div>
  <div id="b37" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspThe answer is clear. I am you. You are me. Waki.</span></div>
