  <div id="b01" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspHave you ever realize that my name Hart Ito, is an anagram of your name, Hatorri?</span></div>
  <div id="b02" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspI'm the soft and bright part of you, Waki. Years of killing seem to turn you into a emotionless monster, but deep down inside, you have the kindness, from the bottom of you heart.</span></div>
  <div id="b03" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspYou want love, to love and to be loved, though you might never realize you did. That creates me, an childish angel, who leads you to the kind-hearted and good-being side.</span></div>
  <div id="b04" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspAnd that's the meaning of my name, heart, which you're always pursuing but never realize it's standing just by your side.</span></div>
  <div id="b05" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspI know your everything, I do. I was observing for a long time and tried to warm you with your own heat.</span></div>
  <div id="b06" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbspSo for all the time, I was talking to... myself?</div>
  <div id="b07" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspCorrect.</span></div>
  <div id="b08" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbspBut...but as you said, you've been always watching. What brought you here? What triggered you?</div>
  <div id="b09" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbsp*Sigh* My dear Waki, haven't you realize that you are just in that goddamn loop state?</span></div>
  <div id="b10" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbsp......</div>
  <div id="b11" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspRethink about all your dreams, they all came true, not because of any mental issues. You predicting dreams are due to the fact that you've experience it all before. </span></div>
  <div id="b12" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbsp......I was</div>
  <div id="b13" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbsp......I was living in my illusion</div>
  <div id="b14" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbsp......I was living in my illusion right now?</div>
  <div id="b15" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspCorrect. These five days, starting from Oct 18th, you've iterated for 6,471 routines already.</span></div>
  <div id="b16" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspAll of this, from Electrohead's murder, till you found that tape, you went through them thousands times.</span></div>
  <div id="b17" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspSome of the plots left unshakable marks in your mind, like Electrohead's begging, Vermillion's panic, Silence of the prison and the content on that tape.</span></div>
  <div id="b18" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspBut luckily, you haven't suffer that much. Your haunting nightmare is simply some sound, unlike Electrohead.</span></div>
  <div id="b19" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspRemember him? He smoked Elixir, which brought him into loop state, too. But his looping routine is three hours.</span></div>
  <div id="b20" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspBy now he has been through over 3.7 million times of looping. And that's why his dream was clear enough to help him recall who you are and what you did.</span></div>
  <div id="b21" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbspBut then, what is actually happening in the real world?</div>
  <div id="b22" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbsp*Sigh*</span></div>
  <div id="b23" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspYou are dying. Right after you listened to the tape that uncovering Elixir's secret, the sniper on the next building's roof aimed at your head.</span></div>
  <div id="b24" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspYou are living through the last three minutes of your life. For the fact that your mind is running extremely fast, though you've gone through 6,471 routines. It's only two and a half mins.</span></div>
  <div id="b25" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbsp...I understand.</div>
  <div id="b26" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspYou know what I'm here? Not because you're looping, I hope that I can put you out of your misery.</span></div>
  <div id="b27" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspYour fate is written. Anything happened inside your brain can't change your real fortune at all.</span></div>
  <div id="b28" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspThat's why I want you to break free with me. No more loop, no more haunting nightmare. </span></div>
  <div id="b29" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspRemember our promise? We're gonna go somewhere better. Somewhere...further, much further than beyond those hills.</span></div>
  <div id="b30" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspAnd there's only one kind of force that can help us make it. Your will. Stop meaningless repetition. Time to wake up and embrace your life.</span></div>
  <div id="b31" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbspOk. I'm gonna go with you.</div>
  <div id="b32" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspThanks.</span></div>
  <div id="b33" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspThere's still thirty seconds of your remaining life. What you gonna do for this time?</span></div>
  <div id="b34" class="box" hidden="true"> &nbsp&nbspI don't really have an idea. Why not pay a visit to a place that gives me inner peace for the last time? </div>
  <div id="b35" class="box" hidden="true"> <span class="lolita">&nbsp&nbspHart:<br>&nbsp&nbspSure, where is it?</span></div>
