    As a samurai, you are much luckier than lots of fellows.<br>
    Killing didn't turn youself into a emotionless monster,<br>
    And you found someone that you can give your heart to.<br>
    But when the real enemy comes,<br>
    Due to a mistake, you didn't have the power against them,<br>
    Fighting for your loving ones, you drew your Wakizashi and went to your death unflinchingly.<br>
    Hart's real, and she's saved. She found your body on the street, buried you and engraved your name "Waki".<br>
    God, can you imagine how grief she is?<br>
    -  THE END  -<br>
  </center></div>
